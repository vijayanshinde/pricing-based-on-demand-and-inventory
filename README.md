# Primal-Dual Learning Algorithm for Personalized Dynamic Pricing

This repository, **`pricing-based-on-demand-and-inventory`**, contains a complete implementation of the *Primal-Dual Learning Algorithm for Personalized Dynamic Pricing with Inventory Constraints*, based on the research paper by Ningyuan Chen and Guillermo Gallego. The project combines **machine learning, optimization, and dynamic pricing** to solve a real-world challenge: maximizing revenue under limited inventory while serving different customer types.

## üìä Project Overview

Dynamic pricing is a key tool in industries like e-commerce, telecommunications, cloud computing, and transportation. The challenge lies in **setting prices dynamically** while accounting for:

- Inventory constraints  
- Customer heterogeneity  
- Uncertainty in demand  

This project addresses the challenge using a **Primal-Dual optimization framework**, where:

- The **Primal problem** maximizes revenue under constraints  
- The **Dual problem** estimates the *shadow price* of inventory to guide pricing  
- The algorithm operates in two phases:
  1. **Exploration** ‚Äî Learn demand curves via experimental pricing  
  2. **Exploitation** ‚Äî Use learned models to optimize pricing dynamically

## üöÄ Key Features

- **Demand Simulation**
  - Logistic demand functions with noise injection
  - Multiple customer types (Reserved vs Preemptive)

- **Demand Estimation via Machine Learning**
  - Non-parametric models: Random Forests & LightGBM
  - Captures non-linear demand behavior

- **Optimization Techniques**
  - Dual variable estimation via `scipy.optimize`
  - Interval narrowing for convergence
  - Oracle revenue benchmark for regret analysis

- **Dynamic Pricing Strategy**
  - Real-time price adaptation based on inventory and customer type
  - Near-optimal performance with minimal regret

- **Evaluation Metrics**
  - Revenue vs Oracle
  - Regret analysis
  - Visualizations: demand curves, price intervals, revenue trends

## üß∞ Technologies Used

- **Language:** Python (Jupyter Notebook)
- **Libraries:**
  - `numpy`, `pandas` ‚Äî data handling
  - `scipy.optimize` ‚Äî optimization
  - `matplotlib`, `seaborn` ‚Äî visualization
  - `scikit-learn` ‚Äî Random Forests, GridSearchCV
  - `lightgbm` ‚Äî boosting for demand estimation

---

## üìà Results

- Learned demand functions that are **price-sensitive and stochastic**, mimicking real customer behavior  
- Achieved near-oracle revenues with regret consistently between **0% and 10%**, well within the 15% threshold cited in the literature  
- Regret effectively measures deviation from the optimal (oracle) revenue  
- Demonstrated the power of combining **machine learning with optimization theory** in pricing problems

## üåü Why This Project Stands Out

- Integrates **ML + optimization** in a full pipeline  
- Goes beyond toy problems ‚Äî implements a **research-grade algorithm**  
- Relevant to **data science, fintech, and telecom** industries  
- Demonstrates practical skills in:
  - Applied ML (Random Forests, LightGBM)  
  - Optimization under uncertainty  
  - Translating academic research into working code
