# Primal-Dual Learning Algorithm for Personalized Dynamic Pricing

This repository contains a **complete implementation** of the *Primal-Dual Learning Algorithm for Personalized Dynamic Pricing with Inventory Constraints*, based on the research paper by Ningyuan Chen and Guillermo Gallego. The project combines **machine learning, optimization, and dynamic pricing** to solve a real-world challenge: maximizing revenue under limited inventory while serving different customer types.

##  Project Overview

Dynamic pricing is a fundamental tool in modern industries such as e-commerce, telecommunications, cloud computing, and transportation. The key challenge lies in **setting prices dynamically** while accounting for:

* Inventory constraints
* Customer heterogeneity
* Uncertainty in demand

This project addresses the challenge using a **Primal-Dual optimization framework**, where:

* The **Primal problem** represents maximizing revenue under constraints.
* The **Dual problem** estimates the *shadow price* of inventory, guiding price decisions.
* The algorithm operates in two phases:

  1. **Exploration:** Learn demand curves using experimental pricing.
  2. **Exploitation:** Apply learned demand models to optimize pricing dynamically.

##  Key Features

* **Demand Simulation:**

  * Logistic demand functions to capture realistic customer behavior.
  * Noise injection to reflect market randomness.
  * Multiple customer types (Reserved vs Preemptive) with different price sensitivities.

* **Demand Estimation via Machine Learning:**

  * Implemented using **Random Forests** and **LightGBM** for non-parametric demand curve fitting.
  * Captures non-linearities and variability better than classical parametric models.
  * Enables robust prediction of demand at untested prices.

* **Optimization Techniques:**

  * Dual variable estimation using `scipy.optimize` minimization routines.
  * Interval narrowing strategy to converge to optimal pricing decisions.
  * Oracle revenue benchmark for regret analysis.

* **Dynamic Pricing Strategy:**

  * Prices adapted in real time based on customer type and inventory availability.
  * Exploitation phase ensures near-optimal performance with minimal regret.

* **Evaluation Metrics:**

  * **Revenue:** Actual vs Oracle.
  * **Regret:** Cumulative difference between algorithm and benchmark.
  * **Visualization:** Demand curves, price intervals, revenue trends.
